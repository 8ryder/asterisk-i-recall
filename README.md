# asterisk-i-recall

An implementation that allows me to say the caller who of my extensions searched for them.

Example:
Bob from extension 203 calls Mary on her cell phone and Mary doesn't answer.
After 20 minutes Mary calls the Bob's company number, but she doesn't know who searched her.

Solution: if Mary calls and there is a call to her phone in last 20 minutes, I will say her that she was called from the 203 extension.
